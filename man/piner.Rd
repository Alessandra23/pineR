\usage{
piner(
  npop = 1000,
  ntimes = 10,
  ngen = 1,
  data,
  species = 1,
  depth = 1,
  owp = 100,

\arguments{
\item{npop}{An integer specifying the number of individuals in the population (default: 1000).}

\item{ntimes}{An integer specifying the number of iterations for the simulation (default: 10).}

\item{ngen}{An integer specifying the number of generations to simulate (default: 1).}

\item{data}{A data frame containing daily weather data with columns for
minimum temperature, maximum temperature, day, month, and year.}

\item{species}{A character string or an integer specifying the tree species.
Where 1 and 2 represent, "pine" (default) and "spruce", respectively.}

\item{depth}{A numeric value representing the depth of the tree stump in meters (default: 1).}

\item{owp}{A numeric value between 0 and 100 specifying the overwintering percentage (default: 100).}

\item{output}{An integer specifying the output. Where 0 is no output, 1 prints summary statistics,
and 2 prints summary statistics along with outputting egg emergence time plots.}

\item{seed}{An integer for the random seed to ensure reproducibility of the simulation.}
}
\value{
A list of summary statistics, including mean temperature, mean first dispersal day,
mean last dispersal day, mean first emergence day, mean first overwintering day,
and the percentage of the year with no overwintering.
Additionally, summary statistics for life cycle stages are provided, such as the
proportion of individuals with 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 or more years in their life cycle.
}
\description{
The piner function simulates the life cycle of the pine weevil,
Hylobius abietis, using a weather generator and user-defined parameters.
The model simulates population dynamics, including overwintering, emergence,
dispersal, and oviposition. It returns summary statistics and can be used to
understand how the life cycle of the pine weevil is affected by climate and other factors.
