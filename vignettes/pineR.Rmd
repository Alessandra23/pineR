## Model set up

Tables 1, 2, and 3 below present the stages of the model and sub-models used, along with the default parameter values. These stages can be arranged into a set of independent modules:

  * 1: Oviposition and egg development, comprising Stages 0 and 1.
  * 2: Dispersal, oviposition, and egg development, encompassing Stages 8, 9, 10, and 1.
  * 3: Larval development, represented by Stage 2.
  * 4: Prepupal and pupal development, encompassing Stages 3 and 4.
  * 5: Emergence and, if necessary, overwintering, corresponding to Stage 6.
  * 6: Maturation feeding, corresponding to Stage 7.

Furthermore, there is a module solely employed in the first generation that includes the initial oviposition.

## List of parameters

The `setParameters` function sets various parameters for use in the \code{piner} function. A full list of the default parameters that are set are shown in Table 1. Before examining Table 1, we define some notation:

* The stage-specific parameters are represented as either $thX$ or $tXname$, where $X$ corresponds to a specific stage (1 to 10). 
* $thX$ indicates the threshold temperature for that stage. The name component represents the parameter's name within that stage, as listed below.

  * $m$ - mean
  * $sd$ - standard deviation
  * $Y$ days - number of days (for event denoted by $Y$)
  * $lim$ - a limit
  
* Temperatures referred to in the table are:
  + 1: Stump temperature at 10 cm, $s10$, calculated using the recursive model with the parameters given in Table 2.
  + 2: The maximum air temperature ($maxtemp$) given by the Weather Generator.
  + 3: Warm/Cold days: Days are categorized based on the application of the parameter $th6$, which has a default value of 9, to $s10$ and $temp$. $temp$ represents the average of the highest and lowest air temperatures provided by the Weather Generator.
     * (a): Warm when both $temp$ and $s10$ are greater than $th6$.
     * (b): Cold when both $temp$ and $s10$ are less than $th6$.
     * (c): Intermediate otherwise.
  + 4: The depth of the stump temperature is chosen from $s10$, $s20$, or $s30$. The values used to compute $s10$ and $s30$ are listed in Table 2. For a depth of 20 cm, the temperature ($s20$) is determined by averaging the temperature at 10 cm and 30 cm.
  
* Additionally, the following function notation is used:
  + $DD(t,a) = r$ : $r$ day degrees for temperature $t$ with threshold $a$ are required.
  + $vN(n,sd)$ : Value from a Normal distribution with mean $m$ and standard deviation $sd$.
  + $vllg(m,k)$ : A value from a log-logistic distribution with $median = m$ and $b = 1/k$, where $k$ is often called the _shape_ parameter.
  + The response function is given by: $logistic(x;a,b,c,d) = a + c/(1+exp(b*(x-m)))$

## pineR Function

The `piner` function simulates the life cycle of the pine weevil,
Hylobius abietis, using a weather generator and user-defined parameters.
The model simulates population dynamics, including overwintering, emergence,
dispersal, and oviposition. It returns summary statistics and can be used to
understand how the life cycle of the pine weevil is affected by climate and other factors. It returns a list of summary statistics, including mean temperature, mean first dispersal day,
mean last dispersal day, mean first emergence day, mean first overwintering day,
and the percentage of the year with no overwintering.
Additionally, summary statistics for life cycle stages are provided, such as the
proportion of individuals with 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 or more years in their life cycle.

The arguments for this function are:

* `data` A data frame containing daily weather data with columns for  minimum temperature, maximum temperature, day, month, and year.
* `npop` An integer specifying the number of individuals in the population (default: 1000).
*  `ntimes` An integer specifying the number of iterations for the simulation (default: 10).
*  `ngen` An integer specifying the number of generations to simulate (default: 1).
*  `species` A character string or an integer specifying the tree species.  Where 1 and 2 represent, "pine" (default) and "spruce", respectively.
*  `depth` A numeric value representing the depth of the tree stump in meters (default: 1).
*  `owp` A numeric value between 0 and 100 specifying the overwintering percentage (default: 100).
*  `output` An integer specifying the output. Where 0 is no output, 1 prints summary statistics, and 2 prints summary statistics along with outputting egg emergence time plots.
* `seed` An integer for the random seed to ensure reproducibility of the simulation.

In the code below, we show a practical demonstration using the built-in data. to begin we simulate the model:

```{r, model}
library('pineR')
# load data
data('weatherData')


pinew <- piner(data = weatherData,
               npop = 20,
               ntimes = 10,
               ngen = 1,
               species = 'pine',
               depth = 2,
               seed = 12,
               output = 1)

```

Examining the output gives us:

```{r, output, out.width='100%', out.height='100%', eval=FALSE}
pinew$gemtime_new_t0 |>  hist()
```

Similarly, we can set the `output = 2`, which will automatically create plot of....

```{r, model2, out.width='100%', out.height='100%', eval=F}


pinew <- piner(data = weatherData,
               npop = 20,
               ntimes = 10,
               ngen = 1,
               species = 'pine',
               depth = 2,
               seed = 12,
               output = 2)

```
